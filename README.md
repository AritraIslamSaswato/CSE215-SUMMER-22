- **Pre-requisites:** <span style="color:green">CSE 173 Programming Language I</span>

## Course Summary
This course introduces the basic concepts and techniques of object-oriented programming. Actual computer programs are constructed by applying object-oriented programming concepts and using an OOP language. <span style="color:red">Java is primarily chosen as the programming language in this course.</span> The following topics are covered:

- <span style="color:purple">Java syntax with elementary programming</span>
- <span style="color:purple">Primitive data types, strings, operators, statements, arrays, and methods</span>
- <span style="color:purple">Introduction to OOP: classes and objects, constructors, polymorphism, abstract classes, and interfaces</span>
- <span style="color:purple">File I/O operations</span>
- <span style="color:purple">Handling exceptions in Java</span>
- <span style="color:purple">GUI development</span>
- <span style="color:purple">Multithreading</span>
- <span style="color:purple">Generics and related concepts</span>

## Course Objectives
The objectives of this course are to:

1. <span style="color:orange">Become familiar with the basics of elementary programming such as variables, conditional and iterative execution, arrays, and methods in Java.</span>
2. <span style="color:orange">Understand the attributes of object-oriented programming (encapsulation, polymorphism, etc.) and concepts of OOP such as method overloading, method overriding, static and dynamic binding, abstract classes, interfaces, and visibility modifiers.</span>
3. <span style="color:orange">Design a programming solution using the object-oriented programming concept, and apply the concepts of exception handling, graphical user interface (GUI), event-driven programming, multi-threaded programming, and generics in Java.</span>
4. <span style="color:orange">Introduce Java SDK and Java IDE tools to develop Java applications with debugging.</span>
5. <span style="color:orange">Work in a project team to support and collaborate as a team member to develop applications.</span>
